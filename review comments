1. Can we create PR to follow code review process? Putting comments on code/implementing review comments is easier that way.
2. Add .mvn/wrapper, mvnw and mvnw.cmd in .gitignore.
3. Name the projects like ServiceRegistry instead of UserRegistration and UserService instread of SingleUserRegistration to describe purpose of modules
4. Replace application.properties files with application.yml
5. Please remove all commented lines from code
6. Are we following TDD? No test written in SingleUserRegistration while main code is present.
7. https://github.com/rdutta-repo/Pharmacy/blob/master/SingleUserRegistration/src/main/java/com/example/exam/model/UserBean.java 
	use Lombok plugin instead of writting getter/setter. Why do we need to write toString? If you don't need it right now, don't write it.
8. https://github.com/rdutta-repo/Pharmacy/blob/master/SingleUserRegistration/src/main/java/com/example/exam/controller/UserController.java
	Try to return proper HttpResponse code like CREATED/DELETED instead of 200 always from each controller method.
